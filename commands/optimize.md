Use the gradle-performance skill to analyze and optimize the Gradle build in the current directory.

First, profile the build to identify bottlenecks, then provide specific optimizations.

Focus areas:
1. Build configuration time reduction
2. Task parallelization opportunities
3. Build cache hit rate improvement
4. Configuration cache enablement
5. JVM argument optimization
6. Daemon configuration

Provide specific, actionable optimizations with expected impact.
