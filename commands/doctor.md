Use the gradle-doctor skill and the gradle-doctor-agent to perform a comprehensive health check on the Gradle project in the current directory.

Analyze:
1. Performance - configuration time, task execution, parallelization
2. Caching - build cache and configuration cache setup
3. Dependencies - conflicts, version management, resolution
4. Structure - project organization, conventions

Provide actionable recommendations prioritized by impact.
